# Auth Flash Tool Official Released Model (All Versions)


Auth Flash Tool is a Windows-based utility used to flash firmware, recovery files, or custom ROMs on MediaTek (MTK) devices. It works as an alternative to SP Flash Tool but specifically allows flashing on devices that require authentication (Auth) files.

Since many newer MTK devices are locked and require an authentication bypass to flash, Auth Flash Tool helps users perform flashing without needing the manufacturerâ€™s official auth file.
